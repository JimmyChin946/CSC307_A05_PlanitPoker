# Review
### What is good in the project 
- The application is not bloated 
- Taiga import functionality was smoother than expected
- Graphs look very clean with the JFreeChart library
- Connecting all of the information in one data repository made publishing and subscribing easy

### Improvements for next sprint (new features)
- Add more voting methods (right now we just have Sequential and Fibonacci)
- Bring back the manual story creation to add more stories on the fly (A05 original implementation)
- Entire Java Swing Graphics could look more modern
- Make profiles for users
- Make preset teams that can be invited all at once
- Add multiple hosts that can add stories

# Retrospective
### What went well?
- Teamwork was amazing. All the calls were smooth, and everyone did their part
- Using the design patterns (like singleton and observer/observable) made data handling very easy and intuitive.
- JFreeChart made graphing information very easy

### What did not go well?
- MQTT queue was finicky to get working with multiple people in the beginning
- Defining the Host and Client and their respective responsibilities was a lot to juggle
- Originally drew charts manually without the JFreeChart library in A05
